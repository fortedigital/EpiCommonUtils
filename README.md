# EpiCommonUtils

This is a set of common stuff which might be helpfull with your day to day EpiServer work

## Installation

It's available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Forte.EpiCommonUtils/)
 
#### HostingEnvironment

Offers several flags saying on which environment solution is working on. It's based on `episerver:EnvironmentName` appSetting:

        IsLocalDev
        IsIntegration
        IsDev
        IsPreProd
        IsProd 


#### Webpack

It offers two methods. 

`public static string GetStylesheetUrl(string name)`


`public static string GetScriptUrl(string name)`

Those return paths to script/stylesheet containing unique hash generated by webpack. If solution is running on `IsLocalDev` it returns path to local webpack dev server.

You can configure path to local webpack dev server by setting `webpack:devServerUrl` appSetting value (the default is `https://localhost:8080/dist/`)

In order this tool work properly it requires file generated by [Assets webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assets-webpack-plugin). Default path checked is set to `/dist/webpack-assets.json`. 
You can override it by setting `webpack:manifestPath` appSetting 

#### FeatureViewLocationRazorEngine

This is extension of `RazonViewEngine` and it sets up location of templates with common pattern we've been using. 
Check source code of `FeatureViewLocationRazorEngine` for path details. 

This is by default initialized by EpiServer startup. You can disable this initialization by setting up `appSetting` called `epiCommonUtils:disableFeatureViewLocationRazor` with value `true`

#### StructureMap - DependencyInjection

In order for `StructureMap` to work as your Dependency Injection container you must register it - separately for MVC and WebApi controllers.
This package will do it for you by default. 

If you wish to disable this registration you can do it by setting flags in `appSettings`:

```xml

<appSettings>
    <!-- Disable MVC registration -->
    <add key="epiCommonUtils:disableStructureMapMvcRegistration" value="true" />
    <!-- Disable WebApi registration -->
    <add key="epiCommonUtils:disableStructureMapWebApiRegistration" value="true" />
</appSettings>
``` 

#### Image html helpers

There are two html helpers method registered. Both of them make use of `PictureProfile` class which is also a part of this package:

```c#
public class PictureProfile
{
    public int DefaultWidth { get; set; }
    public int[] SrcSetWidths { get; set; }
    public string[] SrcSetSizes { get; set; }
    public int? MaxHeight { get; set; }
    public ScaleMode Mode { get; set; }
    public int? Quality { get; set; }
}
```

**ResizedImageUrl**

This will generate url to resized image. Example usage (`Model` is supposed to be `ContentReference` instance):
```razor
<img src="@Html.ResizedImageUrl(Model, 2048, 1000, new PictureProfile{Mode = ScaleMode.Crop})" />
```

**ResizedPicture**

_NOTE: In order this method to load `alt` element properly Image property should be of type `Forte.EpiCommonUtils.Infrastructure.Model.ImageBase`_

This will generate `picture` element with responsive support. So, having defined this (there's no predefined profiles in this package) :

```c#
public static class PictureProfiles
{
    public static readonly PictureProfile Hero = new PictureProfile
    {
        DefaultWidth = 1500,
        SrcSetWidths = new[] { 400, 800, 1200, 1600 },
        SrcSetSizes = new[]
        {
            "(min-width: 1200px) 1400px",
            "(min-width: 1140px) 1140px",
            "(max-width: 1139px) 100vw",
        },           
        Mode = ScaleMode.Crop,
        Quality = 60
    };
}
``` 

by doing this:

```razor
@Html.ResizedPicture(Model, PictureProfiles.Hero)
```

you will get this piece of markup:
```html
<picture>
    <source sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1400px, (min-width: 1140px) 1140px, (max-width: 1139px) 100vw" srcset="/contentassets/92a71a8e82a94be3ab5581d099a68f48/1.jpg?w=400&mode=crop&quality=60 400w, /contentassets/92a71a8e82a94be3ab5581d099a68f48/1.jpg?w=800&mode=crop&quality=60 800w, /contentassets/92a71a8e82a94be3ab5581d099a68f48/1.jpg?w=1200&mode=crop&quality=60 1200w, /contentassets/92a71a8e82a94be3ab5581d099a68f48/1.jpg?w=1600&mode=crop&quality=60 1600w" />
    <img alt="alternate custom" data-object-fit="cover" data-object-position="center" src="/contentassets/92a71a8e82a94be3ab5581d099a68f48/1.jpg?w=1500&mode=crop&quality=60" />
</picture>

```
