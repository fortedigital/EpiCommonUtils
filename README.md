# EpiCommonUtils

This is a set of common stuff which might be helpfull with your day to day EpiServer work

## Installation

It's available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Forte.EpiCommonUtils/)
 
#### HostingEnvironment

Offers several flags saying on which environment solution is working on. It's based on `episerver:EnvironmentName` appSetting:

        IsLocalDev
        IsIntegration
        IsDev
        IsPreProd
        IsProd 


#### Webpack

It offers two methods. 

`public static string GetStylesheetUrl(string name)`


`public static string GetScriptUrl(string name)`

Those return paths to script/stylesheet containing unique hash generated by webpack. If solution is running on `IsLocalDev` it returns path to local webpack dev server.

You can configure path to local webpack dev server by setting `webpack:devServerUrl` appSetting value (the default is `https://localhost:8080/dist/`)

In order this tool work properly it requires file generated by [Assets webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assets-webpack-plugin). Default path checked is set to `/dist/webpack-assets.json`. 
You can override it by setting `webpack:manifestPath` appSetting 

#### FeatureViewLocationRazorEngine

This is extension of `RazonViewEngine` and it sets up location of templates with common pattern we've been using. 
Check source code of `FeatureViewLocationRazorEngine` for path details. 

This is by default initialized by EpiServer startup. You can disable this initialization by setting up `appSetting` called `epiCommonUtils:disableFeatureViewLocationRazor` with value `true`
